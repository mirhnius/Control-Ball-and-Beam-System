# Control_Ball_and_Beam_System
Stabilization and Tracking Control of The Ball and Beam using PID Controllers in MATLAB SIMULINK.

In this project, based on the physical and mathematical modeling of the ball and beam system, I first analyzed the system and examined it in terms of controllability, then checked the stability of its equilibrium points, and so tried to control the system with different methods. The first method was to control the system with the help of initial conditions. The next method is to design a PD controller by removing the unstable pole and adjusting the controller gain. Changes in the state space variables over time after the application of this controller were also investigated. Finally, the performance of these control methods were evaluated and analyzed as provided.
